# AstroNet
E-commerce application for mobile devices. The client was developed in React Native using the Redux Toolkit. For the api, Express and Mongoose were used as ORM of a MongoDB database.
It had the participation of a total of 8 collaborators who actively participated in the creation of each of its parts, they are: Agustin David Gomez, Cristian Gabriel Valtelhas Rubiles, Valeria Mansueto Galeano, Juan Manuel Cuevas, Martin Alonso Gordillo Gonzalez, Mauro Marcelo Nu√±ez Cioci, Erick Osterling Castillo, and Marcelo Henry Litwin.
In this work I participated in the creation of several endpoints of the back end, the creation of the "new product" form and the implementation of the payment gateway.
